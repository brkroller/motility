Each R script corresponds to 1 or more data file(s) in csv format, which together regenerate the analyses in the paper. Scripts and data files are named after their analysis method and dataset. Please note that in the R scripts, the load data section will require the user to either: 1) store the R scripts and data files in the same directory, 2) adjust the filename to include the path to the stored data file or 3) reset the working directory to the path where the data file is stored.
